# Static Type Inference in Ruby
This repository contains a static-based type inference algorithm proposed for the Ruby language. The
content of this repository is organized as follows:
- **dataset**: the projects used to perform type inference.
- **recall_data**: spreadsheets that present the results of the recalls.
- **statistical_data**: R scripts used to compute statistical data.


## Dataset
The static-based type inference algorithm was evaluated in the following nine open-source systems developed in Ruby:
- [Capistrano]()
- [CarrierWave]()
- [Devise]()
- [Resque]()
- [Sass]()
- [Vagrant]()
- [Paperclip]()
- [Grape]()
- [Sidekiq]()
